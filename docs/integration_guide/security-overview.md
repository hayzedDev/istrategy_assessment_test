# Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in our Payment Processing API to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of payment data.

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT-Based Authentication

We use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication with the following security features:

1. **Token Expiration**: All tokens have a configurable expiration time (default: 1 hour)
2. **Blacklisting**: Revoked tokens are blacklisted in Redis to prevent reuse after logout
3. **Signature Verification**: All tokens are signed and verified using a secure algorithm

### Role-Based Access Control

Our API implements strict authorization controls:

1. **Merchant Isolation**: Merchants can only access their own data
2. **Resource Protection**: All endpoints verify ownership of accessed resources

## Data Security

### Sensitive Data Handling

1. **PCI DSS Compliance**: We only store the last 4 digits of card numbers
2. **Sensitive Data Masking**: All sensitive data is masked in API responses
3. **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit

Example of our card number masking:

```typescript
// Only store last 4 digits of card numbers
if (config.cardNumber && config.cardNumber.length > 4) {
  config.cardNumber = config.cardNumber.replace(/\d(?=\d{4})/g, '*');
}
```

### Password Security

1. **Bcrypt Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using bcrypt with appropriate work factors
2. **No Plain-Text Storage**: Passwords are never stored in plain text
3. **Secure Password Reset**: Password reset follows industry best practices

## API Security

### Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse, our API implements rate limiting:

1. **Request Limits**: Maximum 100 requests per minute per IP address
2. **Login Protection**: Maximum 5 login attempts per minute per IP address

### Input Validation

1. **Request Body Validation**: All input is validated using NestJS pipes and class-validator
2. **Type Checking**: TypeScript provides static type checking
3. **Sanitization**: All input is sanitized to prevent injection attacks

### HTTPS Enforcement

All API communications are encrypted using TLS/SSL:

1. **HTTPS Only**: All endpoints require HTTPS
2. **Modern TLS**: Only TLS 1.2 and above are supported
3. **Strong Ciphers**: Only secure cipher suites are enabled

## Webhook Security

### Webhook Signature Verification

All webhooks are signed to verify authenticity:

```typescript
// Verify webhook signature
if (!verifySignature(payload, signature, webhookSecret)) {
  throw new UnauthorizedException('Invalid webhook signature');
}
```

### Endpoint Obfuscation

We use endpoint obfuscation as an additional security layer:

1. **Random URL Segment**: Webhooks use a random string in the URL (`ndsiuhfjwmpeoimfesdfs`)
2. **Reference-Based Routing**: Each webhook specifies the payment reference
3. **Signature Verification**: All webhook calls require a valid signature

## Database Security

1. **Connection Encryption**: Database connections use TLS
2. **Parameterized Queries**: All database queries use parameterized statements
3. **Least Privilege**: Database users have minimal necessary permissions

## Infrastructure Security

1. **Container Isolation**: Services run in isolated containers
2. **Network Segmentation**: Internal services are not directly exposed
3. **Regular Updates**: All dependencies are regularly updated

## Audit & Monitoring

1. **Comprehensive Logging**: All authentication and payment events are logged
2. **Audit Trails**: Changes to sensitive data include audit records
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Suspicious activities trigger alerts

## Incident Response

We have a well-defined incident response plan:

1. **Detection**: Automated systems detect security anomalies
2. **Containment**: Procedures to quickly isolate affected systems
3. **Recovery**: Steps to restore service securely
4. **Post-mortem**: Analysis to prevent future incidents

## Security Headers

Our API implements security headers:

1. **Content-Security-Policy**: Prevents XSS attacks
2. **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
3. **X-XSS-Protection**: Additional XSS protection
4. **Strict-Transport-Security**: Forces HTTPS connections

## Security Testing

1. **Automated Scanning**: Regular automated vulnerability scans
2. **Penetration Testing**: Annual penetration tests by third parties
3. **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code reviews for all changes
