# Webhook Configuration

Webhooks provide a real-time notification mechanism for your integration. This document explains how to configure, secure, and handle webhooks in our payment processing system.

## Overview

Our webhook system notifies your application when payment events occur, such as when a payment is completed, failed, or refunded. Instead of polling our API for updates, you can receive push notifications when these events happen.

## Webhook URL Pattern

The obfuscated webhook endpoints follow this pattern:

```
/webhooks/payment/ndsiuhfjwmpeoimfesdfs/:reference
```

This URL pattern includes:

- A deliberate random string (`ndsiuhfjwmpeoimfesdfs`) to obscure the endpoint
- The payment reference as a path parameter

## Supported Events

Our webhooks can notify you about the following events:

- `payment.initiated` - A new payment has been initialized
- `payment.completed` - A payment has been successfully processed
- `payment.failed` - A payment attempt has failed
- `payment.refunded` - A payment has been refunded

## Best Practices

### Security

1. **Always verify signatures** to prevent unauthorized webhook calls
2. **Use HTTPS** for your webhook endpoint
3. **Keep our webhook secret secure** and don't expose it in client-side code
4. **Implement IP whitelisting** if possible

### Reliability

1. **Respond quickly** (within 5 seconds) to webhook requests to prevent timeouts
2. **Process webhooks asynchronously** for time-consuming operations
3. **Implement idempotency** to handle duplicate webhook deliveries
4. **Set up monitoring** to detect webhook failures
5. **Implement a fallback polling mechanism** in case webhooks fail

### Webhook Handling

1. **Log raw webhook data** before processing for debugging and replay
2. **Log all webhook events** for auditing and debugging

## Webhook Obfuscation

We use endpoint obfuscation as an extra layer of security. While security through obscurity is not a primary defense, it provides:

1. **Reduced attack surface** by making endpoints harder to discover
2. **Protection against automated scanning** by bots and vulnerability scanners
3. **Defense in depth** when combined with other security measures

The random string in our webhook URLs (`ndsiuhfjwmpeoimfesdfs`) acts as a simple shared secret that makes it harder for unauthorized parties to send fake webhook events.
